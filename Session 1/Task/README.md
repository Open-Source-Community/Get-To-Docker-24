### How to deliver tasks 


1. Make a directory (folder) with the name of the session (ex: Session 0, Session 2, etc...).

2. Inside the folder, make a text or markdown file.

3. In the file write each question's number and the command you used to solve it.

4. Some questions may require posting an screenshot, in this case take a screenshot of the required part and rename it to the question number (ex: Q1.png, Q4.png, etc...) and put it in the folder you created with the text or markdown file.

## Task 1

#### First download and run the Script [(Session1.sh)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/Get-To-Docker-24/tree/master/Session%201/Scripts)

##### Q1 How many images are downloaded

##### Q2 Create a container from `alpine` and has it print out what is inside `/etc/hostname` file

##### Q3 Download `ubuntu` image with the `noble` tag

##### Q4 Run a container using `erseco/alpine-php-webserver` image and detach it


- Try going to `localhost:8080`, does it show you anything

##### Q5 The above image `erseco/alpine-php-webserver` is a web server that runs on port 8080, how can we map it to port 55 on our host?

##### Q6 Take a screenshot of the page that is loaded when visiting `localhost:55` after running the container in Q5

##### Q7 Search for the container you ran in Q4 and stop it then delete it
