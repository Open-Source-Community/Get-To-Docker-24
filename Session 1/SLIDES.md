### Virtual Machines

* A VM is a software that emulates an entire computer, with its kernel, architecture and resurces.

---

<!--_color: #455a64-->

### Containers

- Containers are virtual environments that keep applications and software isolated from the host system.

- Containers have been around for a long time but building them manually can be challenging, this is where Docker comes in.

- Docker uses existing container engines to provide consistent containers.

### VM vs Containers

There is no "which is better" argument here as each one has its own use cases and benefits and disadvantges

But some differences to note:

- VMs are larger in size and resource consumption
- Containers require a Linux kernel to operate while VMs can be run on any OS
- Containers are usually faster and use resource needed only

# <!--fit-->Why Docker?

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

# What is Docker?

- Docker is a command-line program, a background daemon and a set of services that helps in solving common software problems.

- It accomplishes this using containers.

## WSL

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a Linux environment in your Windows machine.

- WSL's terminal is the same as a Linux terminal, so we need to look through some basic commands that will help us navigate through it

---

<!--_color: #455a64-->

## Bash

Bash is a shell and a command language, it's the most common shell to be found on Linux machines and WSL uses it too, let's look through some commands that is a must know in Bash.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

- `cd` stands for Change Directory, use it to go to another directory (folder)
- `ls` stands for List, use it to list all files and directories in your working directory
- `touch` creates a file
- `cp` stands for Copy
- `mv` stands for Move, same thing as Cut (Ctrl + X)
- `rm` stands for Remove, deletes files
- `mkdir` stands for Make Directory, use it to create new directories (folders)
- `cat` prints contents of a file

## Basic Docker commands

* Docker offers lots of functionalties and has lots of commands for specific uses, we will look now at the most common commands that are used with Docker.

* Before using any of these commands we must write `docker` before it.

---

### Images

An image is a packaged application that contains all dependencies, source code and complete environment and configurations of that application, think of it as a blueprint that you use to create instances of the application, these instances are containers.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `run` start a container

* Syntax: `docker run <image_name`
* If the image is downloaded it will start, otherwise it is pulled and downloaded on your machine first.

![height:2in](imgs/DockerRun.png)

* Docker gives containers random names if we don't specify one
* We can give our containers custom names by adding the `--name` to the `run` command
![](imgs/DockerRunName.png)


---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

* When we run a container it is run in attached mode, meaning it's attached to the terminal and we can't use the terminal until it exits.
* We can use the `-d` flag to specify the container running in detached mode.
![](imgs/DockerRunDetached.png)

* To attach a detached container we use `attach` command
![](imgs/DockerAttach.png)

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `ps` lists containers

* Syntax: `docker ps`
* Lists all running containers, and some basic info about them (image, id, name, etc...)
![](imgs/DockerPs.png)

* If we want to list all containers, running or not, we use the `-a` option.
![](imgs/DockerPsA.png)

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `stop` stops containers

Syntax:
- `docker stop <container_name>`
- `docker stop <container_ID>`
* We need to pass the container ID or container name to stop a container, we can find those from the `docekr ps` command.
![](imgs/DockerStopID.png)
![](imgs/DockerStopName.png)

* After running `docker stop` it will print out the name or the ID that we passed.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `rm` removes containers

* Like `stop` we pass either the name or ID of the container, if removed succesfully, it will print out what we passed to it.

## `images` lists images

![](imgs/DockerImages.png)

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `rmi` removes images 

* If we want to delete an image, we must remove all dependent containers first.
![](imgs/DockerRmiError.png)

* Here we tried to delete the image `redis` but we had redis containers, even though they were stopped, it printed an error.

![height:3in](imgs/DockerRmi.png)

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `pull` downloads images

* We saw earlier that when running `docker run` it checks, if the image isn't available on the machine, it downloads it then runs it in a container directly.
* What if we want to only download an image without running a container?
* We use `docker pull` which "pulls" the image without creating a container

![](imgs/DockerPull.png)

<!--_color: #455a64-->

# Practice 1

1) Create a new container from the `alpine` image 
2) Create a new `alpine` container named "test_container"
3) Print out the images currently downloaded
4) Run a new `erseco/alpine-php-webserver` image in detached mode
5) Stop the `erseco/alpine-php-webserver` container
6) Remove the "test_container" container
7) Delete the `busybox` image 

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

* When we run a linux container we will notice that it exits immediately, why is that?

* Containers are not meant to host an OS, it is meant to run a specific task or process, such as host an instance of a web server, database, or simply to carry a computation or analysis task, once this task is complete, it exits.

* This is why when we run an image of an OS, say Ubuntu, it exits immediately.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## Appending commands

- We can append commands after `docker run` to run a specific command in the container when it starts.
- For example `docker run ubuntu sleep 10` will start an Ubuntu container and executes `sleep 10` and after the command exits the container exits too.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## `exec` executes commands

* Okay so we saw how to run a command when we are creating the container, what if we have an already running container, how can we execute a command on it?
* We use `docker exec <container_name> <command>`

## Docker run

- One of the most commands that we use throught our usage of Docker is `run` and it has many options that we benefit from in configuring our containers, we will look at this command in some detail here.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## Tag

* Tags are an identifier that is typically a version number or a variant of an image, if we don't specify a tag, the command uses latest by default.
* Syntax: `<docker run image_name:tag>`
![height:1in](imgs/DockerTagLatest.png)
![height:1in](imgs/DockerTagCustom.png)

* In the first image we didn't specify a tag so it pulled latest, in the second we specified tag 3.18.

* To find all the tags relating to an image we look this image up on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and we will see all tags there.

---

<!--_color: #455a64-->

## Standard input

* Suppose we have a program that takes input, say a script that takes your name and prints `Hello <your_name>`.

* If we dockerize this program and run the container, it will not wait for the prompt, it will just print what it is supposed to on standard output.

* This is because Docker containers doesn't listen to stdin, even though we are attached to the container's console, it's not able to read any input, it doesn't have a terminal, in other terms the container runs in non-interactive mode.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

* We have a program that takes a name and prints `Hello <name>`. This is it running normally
![](imgs/DockerRunSTDIN1.png)
* If we dockerize it and run the container this will happen
![](imgs/DockerRunSTDIN2.png)
* We notice 2 things, first that it didn't take our input (our name in this case), to solve this we add the `-i` flag, which runs the container in interactive mode
![](imgs/DockerRunSTDIN3.png)

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

* Now it takes our input and outputs correctly. But there is still the second problem, the prompt doesn't print, here it should ask first for the name but it doesn't, why? because the application prompts on the terminal and we haven't attached it to the container terminal.
* To solve this we add the `-t` flag which stands for psuedo-terminal.
![](imgs/DockerRunSTDIN4.png)

* So together, `-it` when used with docker run it basically takes us straight into the container's terminal.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## Port Binding

* If we have a web app or server running in a container it will be given an IP on the closed Docker network, so anything outside the container can't access it, to solve this we need to use port binding (mapping) which is binding or mapping the container's port to the hosts's port to make the service available outside the container

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

![bg left width:6in](imgs/PortBinding.png)
* nginx is a web server which runs on port 80, if we try to access the localhost at port 80 we will get nothing because port 80 has nothing on it now, we bind port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host so now accessing the localhost on port 8080 we can access our server.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

- Port mapping is done using the `-p` option with `docker run`

- `docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>`

- Note that only one service can run on this host port.


---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

## Volume Mapping

* Containers have their filesystem isolated from the host, so data stored and modified in the container aren't saved on the host.

* Let's say we have a database container, all data stored in this DB in stored in the container, if this container is removed, all data on the database is lost.

---

<!--_backgroundColor: #cce3ee-->
<!--_color: #455a64-->

- To solve this issue we use volume mapping, where as in port mapping, we map a volume on our container to a volume on our host so data are saved on host and independent of the container in a way.
